Most of the resources in this repository are build for using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. 

Github (the page you are on now) has the ability to render the Jupyter Notebooks in a readable form. However, the rendered form will not have the interactive features or allow you to run the code blocks on your own computer. 

To run the Jupyer Notebook (.ipynb) files, please install Python and Jupyter. The easiest way to do this is using the Anaconda Python distribution, which is available for free:

Enjoy!
